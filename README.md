## Purpose

Kamikaze is an engaging WordPress theme for aspiring bands.

Kamikaze is custom theme loosely based on the WordPress TwentyFourteen theme. The theme is fully compatible
with all wordpress installations. It includes supports for a custom navigation bar, widgets at the footer, posts,
and it works with WordPress's theme customizer.

The project comes with some sample content you can import to explore the theme in its fully glory.

The website comes with a eye-catching landing page, and four other pages.
The news page lists the recent blog posts of the band. The tour page is a custom wordpress page that lists the tour
dates in a fully modifiable form. The video page and music page are also custom wordpress pages showing how Kamikaze can
interact with different kinds of media.


## What's included
   * A complete wordpress installation, note that you have to setup the database if you want to run
    the website.
   * A wordpress export of some sample content

## Functionality
  * Main landing page
  * Navigation bar and other pages
  * News page (blog roll)
  * Operability with WordPress (can insert posts, pages, and widgets in the footer)
  * Fully responsive layout as well. Resize the page in your browser


## How to Setup
  * Copy the theme and put it into your own wordpress installation. Copy the sample data posts if you like.

        OR

  * Take the current wordpress files and run it as is. Note you might need to setup your database to make the app work.

## Known Bugs
  * The news page title might not display properly on small screens like cell phones. The page is still usable.
  * The audio players on the music page might not work due to how media is handled by wordpress import/export.
